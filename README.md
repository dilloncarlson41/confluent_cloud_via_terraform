### Variables

The `workshop.tfvars` file is used to declare variables to be passed as parameters into the main configuration of your module. Update the values in the `workshop.tfvars` file. You can search for the string `xx-replace-xx` to locate all instances of a variable that need your input.

``` zsh
confluent_cloud_csp = "xx-replace-xx"
confluent_cloud_csp_region = "xx-replace-xx"
```
